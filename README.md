# House-Price-Prediction
This is a Kaggle competition, where we are asked to build a model to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa.

Kaggle description: 

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## Practice Skills
- Creative feature engineering 
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

In this project, I experiment with the LASSO and RIDGE regularization techniques, and use the former to identify the most significant factors. I use Shapley values as well to show variable importance, and also use branching points in the Random Forest model to identify significant variables in random forest models.
